image processing concept known as image subtraction -> difference between two frames in a speed camera usually background is same the vehicles that come in front of the background 
the capture only this vehicle subtraction is able to find the difference  
bw forebackground based on the movement 


thre main stages used 

vehicle detection we are use image subtraction for speed 
speed estimation is distance elapsed  
caturing vehicle image 



image subtraction which help us find where the vehicles are 

masking is used to make the image binary by make black and white and one or zero the vehicle would be white and background is black 


erosion is used to dintinguish the foreground sometimes happend when two vehicle are close by they going to detected to so ersion able to find the difference bw objects 

contour detection we are finding the shape the vehicle is coming is and save details and draw a bounding box 


object tractiong we use id and object recognition we find object and see object movement 
object tracking is basically used for videos 
and user speed calculation  start timer to end timer
